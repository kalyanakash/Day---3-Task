This Library Management System is a simple Java-based console application that demonstrates core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts like Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism. It is designed to manage books and users in a library.

The system allows:

Adding books and users

Issuing books to users

Returning books to the library

Viewing available books and registered users

This project is implemented using multi-class structure with real-world modeling of Book, User, and Library classes.
